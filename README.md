# CV-Project
Group: Francesco Vaccari, Michele Minniti, Leonardo Giaretta

Project 1: Top view stitching and tracking (tracking and geometry)
Goal:
 1) Create a top-view stitch of the whole court
 2) Apply detection algorithm on top-view images and evaluate the performances
 3) Apply tracking on the detected bounding box and evaluate the performances

Bonus:
 1) Color-based team identification
 2) Ball tracking


The work has been divided into 3 branches: top-view-stitching, detection-tracking and bonus. Each branch contains all the code used to complete the related project task.

It is possilbe to reproduce the results we obtained by running the desired code. To do so, it's necessary to change the variables containing the paths to folders or videos. These variables can be always found in the first few lines of code. Furthermore, some of the motion detectors require pretrained weights that will have to be downloaded first from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cy5_2L7F5uFqzxb7OI4ecJ4qRwTmILf?usp=share_link

All the videos produced during the top-view stitching part of the project have been uploaded into the following folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/191IxaCMptguOah1zzt2uYEDGIughO5Lq?usp=share_link
